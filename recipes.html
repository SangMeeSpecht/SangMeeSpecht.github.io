	<h1>Bokkeumbap: Fried Rice - TV Show</h1>
	<p>
		This recipe comes from one of my favorite Korean TV shows (KDrama), called "Let's Eat."  In episode 14 of season 2, one of the main characters, a foodie named Dae Young, explains that, "Cooking is the taste of fire."  With the little ingredients left in his friends fridge, he uses the slight scorching of the heat to enhance the flavor of the fried rice.  The reason we use day old rice is because it has less water in it, so when it's fried it'll get chewier, which is the texture you want.  Trust me, it tastes better than it sounds!
