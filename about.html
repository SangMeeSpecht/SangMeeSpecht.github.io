		Hi, my name is SangMee and I love to eat!  Ever since I was a little kid, I remember watching movies or reading books and thinking that the food looked absolutely delicious.  Even animated food looked good to me.  The earliest memory of these experiences was when I was first learning to read with my mom.  I was reading about a naughty boy named Sam who ate all of these jars of jam and it just got me thinking, "Damn, that jam looks good."

		Ever since then, I've been drooling over every image of food I could set my eyes on.  As I grew older, I realized that I didn't just want to look at these foods, I wanted to cook them!  And that's where "Fictitious Feasts" comes in.  I wanted to find a way to share my experience and the the joy I feel as I recreate these fictitious foods found in movies, literature, and television.

		I hope you enjoy exploring this site and even taking a stab at cooking some of these legendary meals.

		Happy eating!
