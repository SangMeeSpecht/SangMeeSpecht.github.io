	<p>
		This website seems to have a lot of CSS elements added to it that make the site look appealing.  It has different sections for things like: navigation bar, tags that group certain recipes together on a page, a banner at the top, popular posts, a blog archive, and a live traffic feed.  It also has a link where you can go back chronologically to "Older Posts.""    
	</p>
	<p>
		One thing that the site could improve upon is the organization of all the different sections.  Some sections, such as the "About Me" one are near the bottom of the page, a place where most people will not see it.  It would be better if those types of sections could be added to the navigational bar at the top.  Also, the author's entire post is is listed on the main page.  It would be easier to navigate if she only had part of the blog post on the main page and a "Read More" link under each post.
